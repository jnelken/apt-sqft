# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced Furniture System feature will improve the existing furniture functionality in the Floor Plan Editor by providing better visual customization, improved user interface integration, comprehensive editing capabilities, and enhanced statistics tracking. This feature will reuse and extend the existing room properties system to create a more cohesive and user-friendly furniture management experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a floor plan designer, I want to customize furniture colors with intelligent defaults, so that my furniture visually complements the room design and maintains aesthetic coherence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds new furniture THEN the system SHALL provide a color selector interface
2. WHEN a user opens the color selector THEN the system SHALL default to a complementary shade of the room color (such as a shade of red)
3. WHEN a user selects a custom color THEN the furniture SHALL immediately update to reflect the new color
4. WHEN no room color is available THEN the system SHALL provide a sensible default furniture color
5. IF a user changes room colors THEN the system SHALL offer to update furniture colors to maintain complementary relationships

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a floor plan designer, I want to drag furniture items from a left panel onto the floor plan, so that I can efficiently place furniture without complex menu navigation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views the application THEN the left panel SHALL display available furniture items
2. WHEN a user drags a furniture item from the panel THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during the drag operation
3. WHEN a user drops furniture onto the floor plan THEN the system SHALL create a new furniture instance at the drop location
4. WHEN a user drops furniture outside the valid area THEN the system SHALL cancel the operation and return the item to the panel
5. WHEN furniture is being dragged THEN the system SHALL show a preview of where the furniture will be placed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a floor plan designer, I want to edit furniture properties in the same way as rooms, so that I have a consistent and familiar editing experience across all floor plan elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on placed furniture THEN the system SHALL display the same editing interface used for rooms
2. WHEN a user edits furniture properties THEN the system SHALL support name, dimensions, position, and color modifications
3. WHEN a user resizes furniture THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate square footage
4. WHEN a user moves furniture THEN the system SHALL update position coordinates in real-time
5. WHEN a user deletes furniture THEN the system SHALL remove it from both the canvas and statistics
6. WHEN furniture editing occurs THEN the system SHALL add the action to the undo/redo history

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a floor plan designer, I want to see comprehensive furniture statistics including total square footage and item count, so that I can make informed decisions about space utilization and furniture density.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN furniture is added to the floor plan THEN the system SHALL calculate and display total furniture square footage
2. WHEN furniture is modified or removed THEN the system SHALL automatically update the furniture statistics
3. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL display the total number of furniture items
4. WHEN viewing statistics THEN the system SHALL show furniture square footage separate from room square footage
5. WHEN multiple floor plans exist THEN the system SHALL calculate statistics independently for each floor plan
6. WHEN statistics are displayed THEN the system SHALL format measurements consistently with existing room statistics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a floor plan designer, I want furniture to integrate seamlessly with existing floor plan features, so that I can use all application capabilities (zoom, grid, themes, etc.) with furniture elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using zoom controls THEN furniture SHALL scale proportionally with rooms and other elements
2. WHEN grid is enabled THEN furniture SHALL snap to grid lines during placement and movement
3. WHEN switching themes THEN furniture colors SHALL adapt appropriately to maintain visibility
4. WHEN using undo/redo THEN furniture operations SHALL be included in the history stack
5. WHEN saving floor plans THEN furniture data SHALL persist to localStorage with all other floor plan data
6. WHEN loading floor plans THEN furniture SHALL restore with all properties and visual state intact
